This smart contract can be used by doctors and administrators to store and manage patient medical records. Patients can also register themselves with the smart contract so that their medical records can be accessed by authorized users.   

Here are some additional features that can be added to this smart contract:   
- Access control for different types of users, such as patients, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists.   
- Support for different types of medical records, such as allergies, immunizations, lab results, and imaging reports.   
- Audit trails to track who has accessed and modified medical records.   
- Integration with other healthcare systems, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and practice management systems.   

This smart contract can be deployed to a blockchain platform, such as Ethereum or Polygon. Once deployed, it can be used by doctors and administrators to manage patient medical records in a secure and transparent way.

The provided code for the `MedicalRecordSystem` contract looks well-structured and follows best practices. However, there are a few optimization suggestions that can be implemented to improve the efficiency and readability of the code:   
- Use a mapping instead of an array for `authorizedUsers`: Instead of iterating over the `authorizedUsers` array to check if an address is authorized, you can use a mapping to store the authorized users. This will provide constant-time lookup and improve the efficiency of the isAuthorized function.   

```shell
mapping(address => bool) public authorizedUsers;

// Constructor to initialize the smart contract
constructor() {
    // Add the contract deployer as an authorized user
    authorizedUsers[msg.sender] = true;
}

// Function to check if an address is authorized
function isAuthorized(address userAddress) public view returns (bool) {
    return authorizedUsers[userAddress];
}
```    

- Use the push function directly when adding a new medical record: Instead of creating a temporary `MedicalRecord` variable and then pushing it to the `medicalRecords` mapping, you can directly push the new record to the mapping. This will simplify the code and reduce gas costs.   

```shell
// Function to add a new medical record for a patient
function addMedicalRecord(address patientAddress, string memory date, string memory diagnosis, string memory treatmentPlan) public onlyAuthorized {
    medicalRecords[patientAddress].push(MedicalRecord(date, diagnosis, treatmentPlan));
}
```   

- Consider using events for important contract state changes: Emitting events for important contract state changes can provide a better user experience and allow external systems to react to those events. For example, you can emit an event when a new patient is registered or when a new medical record is added.   

```shell
event PatientRegistered(address indexed patientAddress, string name);
event MedicalRecordAdded(address indexed patientAddress, string date, string diagnosis, string treatmentPlan);

// Function to register a new patient
function registerPatient(string memory name, address walletAddress) public onlyAuthorized {
    patients[walletAddress] = Patient(name, walletAddress);
    emit PatientRegistered(walletAddress, name);
}

// Function to add a new medical record for a patient
function addMedicalRecord(address patientAddress, string memory date, string memory diagnosis, string memory treatmentPlan) public onlyAuthorized {
    medicalRecords[patientAddress].push(MedicalRecord(date, diagnosis, treatmentPlan));
    emit MedicalRecordAdded(patientAddress, date, diagnosis, treatmentPlan);
}
```   

These optimizations will improve the efficiency and readability of the code. Remember to thoroughly test the contract after making any changes to ensure its correctness.
